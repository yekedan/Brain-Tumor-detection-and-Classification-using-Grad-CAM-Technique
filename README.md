# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Grad-CAM

This project focuses on detecting and classifying **brain tumors** from MRI images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. In addition to achieving strong classification performance, the project incorporates **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to provide **visual explanations** of model predictions — enhancing trust and interpretability in medical AI applications.

## 📘 Project Overview

Brain tumor diagnosis is one of the most critical tasks in medical imaging. While deep learning models can achieve remarkable accuracy, **interpretability** remains a major challenge.
This project bridges that gap by integrating **Grad-CAM**, allowing visualization of the regions of MRI scans that most influenced the model’s decisions.

**Tumor Classes:**

* Glioma
* Meningioma
* Pituitary Tumor
* No Tumor
